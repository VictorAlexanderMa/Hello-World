# Hello-World
My first Repository in GitHub

This is my first time for coding in GitHub.
I haven't written any codes for long time so that I nearly dare not say I am a student who majors in computer science and technology.
Since the past is the past, and I, a mortal being, canâ€™t go back and change it. What is the use of regretting?
Just code from now and never forget the initial dream.
